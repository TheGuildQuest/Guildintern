## 💰 If you plan to launch a token

This framework is the number one open source project on github, we are enabling the next generation of human-machine interface but we still need your help to ensure the code is of the utmost quality with response rapid to critical issues that will affect our builder community at large.

To ensure sustainable development and continued innovation, we ask contributions of 5-10% of initial token distributions from successful launches.

All contributions are publicly tracked on-chain and used exclusively for ecosystem development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Start Eliza 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git

# Checkout the latest release
# This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

### Start Eliza with Gitpod (no need)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/main)

### Edit the .env file

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: .env is optional. If you're planning to run multiple distinct agents, you can pass secrets through the character JSON

### Automatically Start Eliza

This will run everything to set up the project and start the bot with the default character.

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### Edit the character file

1. Open `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

### Manually Start Eliza

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```

#### Notes

1. .env file needs to be updated with:
   - Openai API
   - Twitter information
For twitter, you need to include
   
TWITTER_COOKIES='[
  {"key":"auth_token","value":"your_auth_token","domain":".twitter.com"},
  {"key":"ct0","value":"your_ct0","domain":".twitter.com"},
  {"key":"ct0","value":"your_ct0_again","domain":".x.com"}
]'

2. In .env under Twitter configurations is where all of the posting intervals, search intervals, and small adjustments can be made

3. This is what character file Eliza will use to run the bot:
packages\core\src\defaultCharacter.ts

4. Currently we have created 2 characters to test out. The first is defaultCharacter.ts, and the second is defaultCharacter2.ts . To try the second one, just rename the file to defaultCharacter.ts and run it normally.
